    <p style="color:#471910 ; font-size:larger ;">As our modern society gets more resource-intensive, natural spaces are shrinking and wildlife numbers are

                <td>JAVAN RHINOS <br>
                    Once found throughout south-east Asia, Javan rhinos have suffered a staggering decline in their
                    numbers due to hunting and habitat loss. The lone wild population of Javan rhinos is one of the
                    rarest of the rhino species—around 75 individuals—which can only be found on the island of Java,
                    Indonesia.

                <td>AMUR LEOPARD <br>
                    The Amur leopard is one of the rarest big cats in the world, with only around 100 individuals left
                    in the wild. Although their wild population seems to be stable and increasing, these leopard
                    subspecies are still critically endangered since 1996.</td>

                    The Sunda Island tiger, or the Sumatran tiger, is the smallest tiger subspecies in the world,
                    weighing up to 140kg. For reference, the tigers that live in the Amur region are the biggest of all
                    the big cats where males can weigh up to twice as much as Sunda Island tigers. </td>

                    The Mountain gorilla is a subspecies of the eastern gorilla, which lives in two isolated populations
                    in the high-altitude forests up in the volcanic, mountainous regions of the Democratic Republic of
                    Congo, Rwanda and Uganda, and in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park of Uganda. </td>

                    The Tapanuli orangutan is the newly described species of orangutan, listed as a distinct species in
                    2017. Only a single, isolated population of Tapanuli orangutans exist in the wild, which is
                    restricted to the tropical forests of the Batang Toru ecosystem on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.

                    The Yangtze Finless Porpoise is the odd one out of its family as it is the only living freshwater
                    porpoise found in the world. This aquatic mammal currently resides in the Yangtze River in China and
                    is listed as a critically endangered species. </td>
